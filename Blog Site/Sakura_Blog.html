                    The best times for cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Tokyo, and the surrounding regions are often from the last week of March to the first week of April. Each region of Japan experice this delightful sight at different times during the spring. The Japanese celebrate this season with events and festivials. This is one of the reason most turists travel to the island besides sushi and their temples.

                        My name is James Miller-Suttmeier. I am 41 years young and enjoying this crazy ride called life. I have been to a few schools from Trade to traditional. Currently, I am working on my Bachelor and it feels like I have been doing this forever. What is great about school is that I get to meet new people and learn new things. I actually enjoy being a student. So much so while on my hiatus from school I have found myself doing a lot of self-study. Currently, I am teaching myself how to play the guitar and Japanese.
